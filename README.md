# Student-Data-Analysis

A collaborative project for Agile Processes module.  
We are building a simple data pipeline to import student data, check it for errors, and prepare it for analysis.  
The repo also demonstrates Agile practices (Scrum roles, sprint boards, burndown, retrospectives).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Sprint 1 Goal
Set up the project foundation, verify collaboration tools, and prove we can import and validate a CSV file of student data.

## âœ… Sprint 1 Tasks

1. **GitHub Setup**
   - Create a GitHub repository and invite all team members.  
   - Confirm everyone can clone, branch, and push changes.  

2. **Data Import**
   - Write a Python script to import raw student data from CSV into `/data/raw/`.  
   - Handle errors (file not found, malformed CSV).  

3. **Data Validation**
   - Process imported student data to identify:  
     - Missing/null values  
     - Incorrect/out-of-range values (e.g., attendance %, exam scores)  
   - Save a simple data quality report into `/docs/` or `/data/raw/`.  

4. **Scrum Artifacts**
   - Document Sprint Goal in the board.  
   - Maintain a burndown chart for task tracking.  
   - Write retrospective notes in `/docs/retro-sprint1.md`.
