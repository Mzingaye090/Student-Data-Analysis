## 🧑‍🏫 How to Use the Notebook (Teacher’s Guide)

### 🔗 1. Open the Notebook in Google Colab
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11WBShGRS2aa5CoRRDf8mNxH6_tMmGEl7?usp=sharing#scrollTo=K9ScubvfWFhN)
2. Click **File → Upload Notebook**
3. Upload the file:  CSV file 



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**

- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis

- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization

- **Google Colab** - Cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment



## 📊 Dataset Structure

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `student_id` - Unique identifier for each student

- `hours_studied` - Number of hours studied

- `sleep_hours` - Hours of sleep

- `attendance_percent` - Attendance percentage

- `previous_scores` - Previous exam scores

- `exam_score` - Current exam score

▶️ 3. Run the Notebook

Click Runtime → Run all
(or press Ctrl + F9 / Cmd + F9)

Colab will execute every section in order and show tables and charts below each block.

📘 4. Notebook Sections Explained
1️⃣ Setup

Loads your uploaded CSV file into Pandas and shows the first few rows.

2️⃣ Attendance-Based Performance

Plots Attendance Marks vs Total Marks as a scatter plot.

Displays the correlation between attendance and total score.

3️⃣ Gender-Specific Data

Shows the average Total, Attendance Marks, and Percentage per gender.

Displays a bar chart comparing average scores by gender.

Shows a Gender Count chart.

4️⃣ Histograms

Creates simple histograms for:

Total Marks

Attendance Marks

Percentage (if available)

Helps visualize score distribution and variation.

5️⃣ Lists — Above Average, Below Average, Fail, Didn’t Attend

Automatically generates:

Students above average

Students below average

Students who failed (Grade = F)

Students who didn’t attend any class (Attendance Marks = 0)

6️⃣ Yearly Registration & Gender Count

Shows a bar chart for yearly registration trends (2023–2025)

Prints the number of students per gender registered in the most recent year.

💾 5. Save or Export Results

After running:

To save a chart → right-click on it → Save Image As

To download the whole notebook → File → Download → Download .ipynb

To export as PDF → File → Print → Save as PDF

# Student Exam Scores Analysis

## 📁 Project Files
- `student_exam_scores.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook with data analysis.
- `student_exam_scores.csv` - The original dataset containing student exam information.
- `students_with_gender.csv` - The exported CSV with new features added during analysis.
- `student_S[ID]_marksheet.pdf` - Example PDF marksheet generated by the interactive widget.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization (histograms, pie charts, bar charts).
- **NumPy** - Numerical operations and generation of random data (for `Gender` and `year_registered`).
- **Google Colab** - Cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment.
- **ipywidgets** - Used to create interactive dashboards and controls.
- **ReportLab** - Used for generating PDF marksheets.

## 📊 Dataset Structure
The dataset contains the following columns:

### Original Columns
- `student_id` - Unique identifier for each student.
- `hours_studied` - Number of hours studied.
- `sleep_hours` - Hours of sleep.
- `attendance_percent` - Attendance percentage.
- `previous_scores` - Previous exam scores.
- `exam_score` - Current exam score.

### Derived/Added Columns
- `Average` - The mean of all numeric features (used for binning).
- `Range` - A categorical bin for the `Average` (e.g., "<50", "50-59").
- `Gender` - Randomly assigned 'Male' or 'Female' (120 Male, 80 Female).
- `Average_Score` - The mean of all available numeric columns.
- `year_registered` - Randomly assigned year (2021-2024).
- `adjusted_mark` - The `exam_score` adjusted based on attendance (e.g., +5% for >=90% attendance, -5% for <70%).
