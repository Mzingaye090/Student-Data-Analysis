# Student Exam Scores Analysis

## 📁 Project Files
- `student_exam_scores.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook with data analysis.
- `student_exam_scores.csv` - The original dataset containing student exam information.
- `students_with_gender.csv` - The exported CSV with new features added during analysis.
- `student_S[ID]_marksheet.pdf` - Example PDF marksheet generated by the interactive widget.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization (histograms, pie charts, bar charts).
- **NumPy** - Numerical operations and generation of random data (for `Gender` and `year_registered`).
- **Google Colab** - Cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment.
- **ipywidgets** - Used to create interactive dashboards and controls.
- **ReportLab** - Used for generating PDF marksheets.

## 📊 Dataset Structure
The dataset contains the following columns:

### Original Columns
- `student_id` - Unique identifier for each student.
- `hours_studied` - Number of hours studied.
- `sleep_hours` - Hours of sleep.
- `attendance_percent` - Attendance percentage.
- `previous_scores` - Previous exam scores.
- `exam_score` - Current exam score.

### Derived/Added Columns
- `Average` - The mean of all numeric features (used for binning).
- `Range` - A categorical bin for the `Average` (e.g., "<50", "50-59").
- `Gender` - Randomly assigned 'Male' or 'Female' (120 Male, 80 Female).
- `Average_Score` - The mean of all available numeric columns.
- `year_registered` - Randomly assigned year (2021-2024).
- `adjusted_mark` - The `exam_score` adjusted based on attendance (e.g., +5% for >=90% attendance, -5% for <70%).
